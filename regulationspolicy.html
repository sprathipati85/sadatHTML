				<h3><strong>MONEY LAUNDERING REGULATIONS POLICY</strong></h3>
				<p>
					This company's (Sadat Exchange Ltd) commitment to understanding and minimising its risks in relation to money laundering and terrorist financing and strengthening of our goals of achieving good ethical business and trading standards are contained within this policy statement. Our aim is that by having robust policies and procedures and the creation of the compliance culture within the firm we should assist the prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing An important subsidiary aim is the protection of the company and staff reputations and integrity.</p>
					
				<p> In order to achieve these aims we have undertaken the following; </p>
				<p><strong> 1. Appointment of the nominated person/money laundering reporting officer (MLRO) </strong></p>
				<p>	The company's MLRO is: Mr Said Abdullah Sadat</p>
				       
				<p><strong> MLRO Contact Details 				 </strong>	</p>
				<p>	Internal phone number (+44) 0208 472 5769/(+44) 07984202054	</p>
				<p>Email address:- sadatx@btinternet.com	</p>
				<p>The MLRO is available to discuss any matters relating to the company's policies and procedures relating to the Money Laundering Regulations.	</p>

				<p><strong> 2. Establishment of internal procedures appropriate to the Money Laundering Regulations 2007 </strong></p>
				<p>	These procedures are to prevent money laundering and terrorist financing. We have established appropriate and risk-sensitive policies and procedures relating to:		</p>
				<p> Customer due diligence 		</p>
				<p>	Reporting		</p>
				<p>	Record-keeping		</p>
				<p>	Internal Control		</p>
				<p>	Risk assessment and management		</p>
				<p>	Compliance management and communication 		</p>
				<p>	These procedures are described in our Manual.		</p>

				<p><strong> 3. Establishment of internal training requirements </strong></p>
				<p>These are required so that all individuals within the company may understand their responsibilities within the company's policy and procedures and their wider responsibilities under the UK's anti-money laundering strategy. To this end we will ensure all individuals within the company are trained at regular intervals for: </p>
				
				<p> 				Awareness of the relevant legislation </p>
				<p> Understanding of their roles and responsibilities under the anti-money laundering regime</p>
				<p> Updated on particular threats and alerts for the company or the profession</p>
				<p> On how to recognise potential suspicious activity</p>
				<p> Lines of communications for reporting suspicious activity</p>
				<p> The company's exposure to risk, and</p>
				<p> The company's client due diligence policies and procedures</p>
				
				<p><strong> 4. The maintenance and retention of records for five years after ceasing to act for a client </strong></p>
				
				<p> 				These documents (actual or electronic) are those relating to: </p>
				<p>Client risk assessments</p>
				<p>   Client identity and verification</p>
				<p>   Clients ongoing monitoring</p>
				<p>	Staff training</p>
				<p>	Internal reporting</p>
				<p>	External reporting</p>

				
				<p><strong> 5. Making external suspicion reports </strong></p>
				<p>
				The company through the MLRO has established procedures for assessing internal suspicion activity reports ("SARs") and on the decision making process. We have established procedures for the MLRO to make SARs to the Serious Organised Crime Agency (SOCA) and for the secure retention and storage of copies of internal and external reports.</p>
				
				<p><strong>6. Aiding law enforcement</strong></p>
				<p>
				The company, through the MLRO, has established procedures for aiding any law enforcement agency (police, SOCA, Serious Fraud Office) which obtains a "money laundering investigation order" against its clients. These procedures relate to the collation and secure retention of the information required and systems to ensure that confidentiality of the client is maintained where appropriate.</p>
				
				<p><strong> 7. Individual staff members' commitment to the company's policy and procedures</strong></p>
				<p>
				It is important that individuals understand the compliance culture and their roles and responsibilities that is placed upon them. Individuals should understand that penalties imposed including fines and imprisonment applies to individuals as well as the company. </p>
				<p>So individuals should:- </p>
					<p>Ensure that they understand the company's policy and procedures contained in this document
						Ensure that during the course of their work for the company they don't "turn a blind eye" to the obvious. If they have doubts over the legitimacy of a transaction or event then must follow procedures to discuss the situation or make an internal suspicious activity report. It is only by following these procedures are that staff are protected from the possible penalties contained within the legislation.  </p>
						<p>Must remember that they should not speculate as to whether a crime has been committed. In order for a report to be made there must be reasonable suspicion that a crime has been committed, the client intended for a crime to be committed and there must be proceeds of that crime. An innocent error is not a crime, there has to be an element of intent.</p>
						<p>
						Not be required to be investigators; that is the role of law enforcement.
						</p>
						<p>
						Remember that 'tipping off' is an offence under the legislation. Staff must not discuss what they may or may not report with the client or with colleagues (other than the MLRO, whose job is to make a SAR where believed appropriate) and must not make reports the topic of general conversation within the office. Tipping off (whether involving the subject of a report, a colleague, friend or family) may result in criminal conviction and a prison sentence.
